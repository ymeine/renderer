The base class for all renderers.

# File system layout

* [`index.ls`](./index.ls): module's entry point

# Versioning

To version: _everything_

# API

## Render a full document

### Names

* `render`

### Arguments

1. `input`
	* __required__
	* type: `Object`
	* The object describing the output

### Returns

* type: `String`
* The rendered output

### Backlog

* Suggested additional names:
	* `output`

## Render a section

A section is a whole block with a title (header) of a certain level.

### Arguments

1. `input`
	* __required__
	* type: `Object`
	* The object holding the content of the section
1. `level`
	* __optional__: defaults to `1`
	* type: `Number`
	* The level of the section (i.e. section, subsection, subsubsection, etc.). First level is 1, and this is the most important.

### Returns

* type: `String`
* The rendered output

## Render a list

### Names

* `list`

### Arguments

1. `list`
	* __required__
	* type: `Any Array`
	* The list of items in the list to be rendered
1. `ordered`
	* __optional__: defaults to `fasle`
	* type: `Boolean`
	* If the list must be ordered or not.
1. `level`
	* __optional__: defaults to 1
	* type: `Any Number`
	* The level of nest of the list. It begins at `1`, which is a non-nested list.

### Returns

* type: `String`
* The rendered list

### Backlog

* Add an option to be able to choose the type of bullet? This is more a matter of CSS and co.

## Emphase a text

Emphasis is the process of making a text visually highlighted from the rest of the text.

Here we support two types of emphasis: _italic_ and __bold__ (with possible ___combination___).

### Arguments

1. `text`
	* __required__
	* type: `Any String`
	* The text to be emphased
1. `options`
	* __optional__: see description
	* type: `Object`
	* Options to drive the emphasis. It allows to choose between italic, bold or both. See details below

The `options` object has the following format:

```livescript
{
	i # italic, Boolean
	b # bold, Boolean
}
```

Setting a property to true activates its corresponding rendering.

### Backlog

* What is the good choice for default options? Is it good to keep _all activated_ by default?
* Add names to the options `i` and `b`, at least respectively `italic` and `bold`, but also things like `oblique` (even if theoretically it's not the same as italic)





# Documentation

## Renderer

Convert an object mimicking a document structure to a string in the language of the specified renderer.

This is for simple inputs, as otherwise one would provide a real document model.

The passed object represents sections. Each key is a section name, and the associated value is the content of the section. Objects can be nested, to allow subsections.

A section content, other than section-objects themselves, is an array of paragraph. Each paragraph is separated by a blank line.

Items of a list can be either a string in language of the renderer or a nested array, corresponding to a nested list.

### Backlog

* Allow meta-data on 'native' objects (like to indicate of arrays are ordered or unordered list)
* Introduce an intermediate object, wrapping thoses sections, to enable header and footer for each
* Be able to search for a renderer with a fuzzy search, and also don't use pre-built instances, just create them when needed, and cache them
* try to make common the functions input processing (with default values computation and so on). For now, it's duplicated from a sepcific renderer to another.

# Issues

Be able to declare supported features, notably for now:

* file protocol in link: no
* ...

This is relevant only for simple rendering, otherwise a node could know its context.
