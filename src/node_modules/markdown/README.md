## URL escaping

This is how Markdown SEEMS to handle urls.

The problem: I put urls inside parentheses, interpreted by markdown.

The url itself can contain raw (not encoded) parentheses, conflicting with that in some cases.

However, Markdown seems to count the opening and closing parentheses before detecting the one closing the url container.

I can do the same, and for each encountered parenthesis which would close the container, I'll encode it.

But it's more simple for several things and also more consistent to simply encode all parentheses.
